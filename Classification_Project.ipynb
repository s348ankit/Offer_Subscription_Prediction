    "### Logistic Model for Binary Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "A retail banking institution is going to float a stock trading facility for their existing customer. Since this kind of facitlity is nothing new , company knows that they will have to incetivise their customers for adopting their offerings. One way to incetiwise is to offer discounts on the commision for trading transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue with that is that only about 10% of the customers do enought trades for earnings after discounts to be profitable. Company wants to figure out, which are those 10% customer so that it can selectively offer them discount. there is no magic way to figure that out. So company rolled out this service to about 10000+ of their customers and observed their trading behaviour for 6 months and after that they labelled them into two revenue.grids 1 and 2.\n",
    "using this data, now they want us to build a classification model which can be used to classify their remaining customers into these revenue grids.\n",

    "Logistic Regression in scikit learn already contains penalties. l1 and l2 [Read as L-one & L-two] penalties . l1 penalty is same as lasso penalty where as l2 is same as ridge penalty. parameter C for logistic regression function is the hyperparameter for penalty . However it works in inverse fashion, i.e. if C takes smalle , it means higher penalty. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the case that we have discussed here , we have discussed l1 penalty with value of C as 1. We have left following things for you to try on your own.\n",
